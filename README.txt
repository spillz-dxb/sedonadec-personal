                          ===================================
                          Compiling Sedona on a Raspberry Pi2
                          ===================================
  If you have a Raspberry Pi2/Pi3 and Beagle bone black, you can make it a Sedona Device in just a few minutes!  

  See <a href='http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs'>http://www.raspberrypi.org</a> to find out more about the Raspberry Pi, where 
  to get one, and how to do the initial setup.

  This archive includes native support for accessing the Raspberry Pi2 GPIO pins.


  1. Assumptions
  --------------
  It is assumed that the Raspberry Pi2:

   * is running ArchLinux (may also work for other flavors of Linux)

   * has command line access, most commonly by ssh or telnet

   * has IP connectivity, and route exists to Niagara station or Sedona Workbench

   * can receive files over network (or copy to SD card)

   * is running a time service that syncs the device with network time (recommended)


  2. Required Software to compile (Raspbian or ArchLinux)
  -------------------------------------------------------
    a. python2 (not python3)
    b. Java SE 7 (not 8)
    c. gcc

  3. Commands (user root)
  -----------------------
    a. tar -xvzf jdk-7u60-linux-arm-vfp-sflt.tar.gz (Linux ARM v6/v7 Soft Float ABI)
    b. mv jdk1.7.0_60 /usr/lib/jvm
    c. export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/bin
    d. export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm
    e. cd /root/sedonadev-RPi2/adm
    f. bash --rcfile unix/init.sh
    g. makeunixdev
    h. cd ..
    i. sedonac apps/platRpi.sax
    j. sedonac scode/platRpi.xml
    k. svm scode/platRpi.scode apps/platRpi.sab


 Once the SVM is up and running, the device should be discoverable from your Niagara station 
 or Sedona Workbench through SedonaNetwork.
